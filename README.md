### Hi there 👋

My name is Diego Quezada and I'm from Chile.

I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at Santa Maria Technical University 🥇. This year I'm training as a Data Scientist and Web Developer through online courses and some of my college courses 💻. 

### What I'm doing
- 👀 I'm currently working as Computational Statistics Assitant.
- 🙀 I'm currently working as a Scratch Tutor in an introductory programming course.
- 💙 I'm following the @yesidays preparation path to become a Data Scientist: https://ds-path.netlify.app/sections/ds-path, check it out 😉.
- 🎻 I'm taking violin classes in my college's orchestra with my teacher Marcelino Aracena.

### What I will do
- 🔥 I will develop some Data Science personal projects.
- 🙂 I will update my boring (yet useful?) portfolio (https://diegoquezadac.github.io/my-portfolio/) through Vue.js (because you know ..., it's kind of hipster).
- 📗 I will create my personal blog to talk about ... ummm 🤔, I really don't know, I just want to write about some geeky things sometimes 🤓.
