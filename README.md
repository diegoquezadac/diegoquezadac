## Diego, 23rd version

### Introduction

I'm a Chilean ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± last year **Computer Science Student** at [Federico Santa Maria Technical University](https://usm.cl/). To be more specific, I'm a thesis student applying ML to predict *trade-in* valuations of cars in Europe.

Since April 2022, I'm working as a **Data Scientist** at [Seez](seez.dk): a fast-growing Dubai-based startup.

### Getting started

I had a great time at University learning everything from the fundamentals up to State of the Art ML algorithms. Since my 3rd year as CS student, and after my computational statistics course, I'm an enthusiastic of Data Science mostly focused on ML.

I like to teach and make abstract topics easier. Throughout my degree, I worked as **Teacher assitant** 6 times for courses like discrete math, algorithms and computational statistics.

I did two internships in data-related positions. The first one at [Future AI](https://myfuture.ai/) and the second one at [EY](https://www.ey.com/es_cl) working in a project for the [ESO](https://www.eso.org/public/).

### Developer notes

I enjoy minimalism in all its forms. From how I write notes and how I code to the design of the products I use and even how I dress.

I'm a Python fan. Mostly because everything started with it in 2018 for me, but also because it's the only programming language in which I can do my recurrent tasks using the best libraries out there such as PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas and FastAPI. Nevertheless, I do have fun programming in different programming languages such as C++, Haskell and Dart.
