### Hi there

I'm Diego: a Chilean last year **Computer Science Student** at Federico Santa Maria Technical University 🏰. I really enjoy Data science and minimal software, so there u go! take a look at my side-projects in my repo.

### What I've done
- 📗 I worked as Teacher assitant for courses: discrete math, algorithms and computational statistics.
- 🌠 I've done two data-related internships: the first one at [Future AI](https://myfuture.ai/) and the second one at **EY** in a project for the [Paranal Observatory](https://www.eso.org/public/spain/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/).
- 🎻 I took **violin classes** in my college's orchestra with my teacher *Marcelino Aracena*.

### What I'm doing
- 🚙 I'm working at Seez, a Dubai startup 🐫.
