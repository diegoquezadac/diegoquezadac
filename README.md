### Hi there 👋

My name is **Diego Quezada** and I'm from Chile.

I'm a 4th year **Computer Engineering student** at Santa Maria Technical University 🥇. This year I'm training as a **Data Scientist** through DataCamp and some of my actual college courses 💻.

### What I'm doing
- 📊 I'm currently working as **Data Scientist Junior** at https://myfuture.ai/.
- 👀 I'm currently working as **Computational Statistics Assitant**.
- 🙀 I'm currently working as a **Scratch Tutor** in an introductory programming course for Chilean high school students.
- 💙 I'm following the @yesidays preparation path to become a Data Scientist: https://ds-path.netlify.app/sections/ds-path, check it out 😉.
- 🙂 I'm updating my boring (yet useful?) legacy-portfolio. You can check the new version at https://github.com/diegoquezadac/portfolio, is based on Flask, HTML and CSS.
- 🎻 I'm taking **violin classes** in my college's orchestra with my teacher Marcelino Aracena.

### What I will do soon
- 🔥 I will develop some *Data Science personal projects*. This projects will be presented on my brand new portfolio which I hope will be ready by the end of the year.
- 📗 I will create my personal blog to talk about ... ummm 🤔, I really don't know, I just want to write about some geeky things sometimes 🤓. This blog will be also on my brand new portfolio.
