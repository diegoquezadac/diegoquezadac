### Hi there 👋

My name is **Diego Quezada** and I'm a Chilean last year **Computer Science Student** at Federico Santa Maria Technical University 🏰. I really enjoy Data science 💙, especially Machine learning, that's why this year I'm taking advance classes in this area.

### What I've done
- 📗 I've worked as Teacher assitant of several courses.
- 🌠 I've done two internships: the first one at **Future AI** as a Data scientist Junior and the last one at **EY** as Digital & Data analytics Trainee working in a project for the [Paranal Observatory](https://www.eso.org/public/spain/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/).
- 🎻 I took **violin classes** in my college's orchestra with my teacher *Marcelino Aracena*.

### What I'm doing
- 👨‍🏫 I'm working as **Computational statistics lab assitant** at Federico Santa Maria Technical University.
- 🚙 I'm working as **Junior Data Developer** at Seez, a Dubai Company 🐫. 
- 👽 I'm working as a freelance **Data scientist** at Future AI. BTW check out their [webpage](https://myfuture.ai/), it's kinda cool.
