### Hi there 👋

My name is **Diego Quezada** and I'm from Chile.

I'm a 4th year **Computer Engineering student** at Santa Maria Technical University 🏰. I really enjoy Data Science and Web Development!, here you will find some of my projects ❤️.

### What I'm doing
- 📊 I'm currently working as **Freelance Data Scientist** at https://myfuture.ai/.
- 👨‍🏫 I'm currently working as **Computational Statistics Assitant**.
- 🎻 I'm taking **violin classes** in my college's orchestra with my teacher Marcelino Aracena.

### What I will do soon
- 📙 I will update my boring (yet useful?) legacy-portfolio using Vue JS. I will incorporate a blog to write some computer science and statistics notes and thoughts.
